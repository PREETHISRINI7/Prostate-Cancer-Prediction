In the Prostate Cancer Prediction project, machine learning methodologies were employed to develop a predictive model for identifying individuals at risk of prostate cancer. The project involved the acquisition and preprocessing of a comprehensive dataset, integrating patient clinical data, genetic markers, and relevant medical history. Through a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), key features were extracted and missing data imputed, ensuring the dataset's readiness for model development. Various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting, were implemented and fine-tuned using cross-validation techniques. The resulting model showcased its efficacy in accurately predicting the likelihood of prostate cancer, providing a valuable tool for early detection and risk stratification.
